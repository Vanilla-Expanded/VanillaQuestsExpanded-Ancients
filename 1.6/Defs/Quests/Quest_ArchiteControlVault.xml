        <li>questDescription(askerIsNull==True)->After intercepting the broadcasting station, we have identified an additional ancient laboratory site communicating with the previous. The lab is transmitting a code red signal, likely signifying an even stronger threat presence. It appears some of the monstrosities might have even escaped underground containment and broken onto the surface.\n\nThe site must contain an additional broadcasting station responsible for the message. It is imperative that we also intercept this broadcast on-site, to track where it is broadcasting to. Functioning technology at the site may prove useful in the improvement of supersoldier production. We should look at each piece of equipment carefully to take back with us if we intend to reliably produce supersoldiers of our own.</li>
